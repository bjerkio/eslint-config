# eslint-config

These are Bjerk's eslint config, used on most of our projects.

This is derived work from [runeh](https://github.com/runeh) and Indiv AS:
https://github.com/runeh/typical-fetch/blob/main/.eslintrc.json

We'd **actually** love more users of our config, so if you have ideas on
improvements â€“ please file an issue or pull request!

```shell
yarn add @bjerk/eslint-config
```

If you want help installing the bunch of peerDependencies for this package,
consider using this:

```shell
npx check-peer-dependencies
```

We often use this along with `@cobraz/prettier`, a shared Prettier config.
